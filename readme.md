## commands used => 

`docker compose up -d` :  
* start and run container in docker compose.yml 
* -d (detached mode) runs the containers in the background without attaching them to your terminal.
* `--build` this will forces build new image

`docker compose logs`: 
* to see the logs for the containers `-f` for real time

`docker compose down -v `: 
* to stop containers 
* remove volumes 
* remove network 

`docker exec -it postgres-db psql -U user -d myappdb`
* logged in as user 
* with database name myappdb

`docker stats express-app`
* show resourse usage 

`docker network inspect networking_name` 
* see information about network like container and ip for gateway for this containers

Hereâ€™s an improved version of your steps for attaching Docker to the container, installing Docker Compose, and integrating Jenkins with GitHub using webhooks:

---

## **1. Attaching Docker to Jenkins Container**

In order to allow Jenkins running inside a container to use Docker on the host system, we need to attach the Docker socket. This enables Jenkins to manage Docker containers directly from within its container.

### **Steps:**
```bash
docker run -d \
  --name jenkins \
  --privileged \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \  # Mount Docker socket
  -v jenkins_home:/var/jenkins_home \  # Persist Jenkins data
  -p 8080:8080 \  # Jenkins Web UI
  -p 50000:50000 \  # Jenkins agent communication
  jenkins/jenkins:lts  # Use the Jenkins LTS image
```

Explanation:
- `--privileged` allows the Jenkins container to interact with Docker on the host.
- `-v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock` ensures that Docker commands issued from inside the Jenkins container are forwarded to the host's Docker daemon.
- `-v jenkins_home:/var/jenkins_home` persists Jenkins data so it survives container restarts.

## **2. Installing Docker Compose Plugin Inside Jenkins Container**

Docker Compose is used to define and run multi-container Docker applications. To allow Jenkins to use Docker Compose from within the container, follow these steps:

### **Steps:**
```bash
# Install Docker Compose plugin
mkdir -p ~/.docker/cli-plugins/  # Create the directory for Docker Compose plugin
curl -SL "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/v2.32.2/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o ~/.docker/cli-plugins/docker-compose  # Download Docker Compose
chmod +x ~/.docker/cli-plugins/docker-compose  # Make it executable
docker compose version  # Verify installation
```

Explanation:
- This installs Docker Compose as a plugin within Docker CLI in your Jenkins container, enabling Jenkins to run `docker compose` commands.

## **3. GitHub Webhook Integration with Jenkins**

### **Using Smee.io for Webhook Payload Delivery:**
To allow Jenkins to respond to GitHub push events, we need to expose localhost to the internet. Smee.io is a service that helps tunnel local webhook payloads to a publicly accessible URL.

### **Steps:**

1. **Setup Smee.io Webhook Tunnel:**

   - Go to [Smee.io](https://smee.io/) and click "Start a New Channel."
   - This will provide you with a URL that forwards requests to your local Jenkins instance.

2. **Run Smee Command:**

   Open a terminal and run the following command to link the Smee.io service with your local Jenkins webhook URL:

   ```bash
   smee -u https://smee.io/your-channel-id --target http://localhost:8080/github-webhook/
   ```

   Replace `your-channel-id` with the channel ID provided by Smee.io. This will forward incoming webhook requests from GitHub to Jenkins.

3. **Configure GitHub Webhook:**
   - Go to your GitHub repository.
   - Navigate to **Settings > Webhooks > Add webhook**.
   - In the **Payload URL**, enter the URL provided by Smee.io (e.g., `https://smee.io/your-channel-id`).
   - Set the content type to `application/json`.
   - Select the events you want to trigger the webhook (e.g., **Push events**).

4. **Test Webhook:**
   After configuring the webhook in GitHub, push changes to your GitHub repository. Jenkins should trigger automatically, receiving the webhook payload and starting the appropriate jobs.
